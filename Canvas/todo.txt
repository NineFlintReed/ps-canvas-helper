EVERYTHING
    Once sorted, add the try/catches to the process blocks
    check over the [OutputType] for all funcs
    Eventually convert types to actual dotnet? Might be nice to make stuff read-only
    Let all unset params map to the default values

Add-CanvasEnrollment
    allow section/course pipeline input so I can do this:
        Get-CanvasCourse -Search '08 mathematics 01-2023' | New-CanvasEnrollment -UserId 3546 -Role Student
        Get-CanvasUser -Search 'login@email.com' | New-CanvasEnrollment -CourseId 5000 -Role Student
    add additional flags
        limit_privileges_to_course_section
        self_enrolled
        notify

Remove-CanvasEnrollment
    allow flag to change between delete/conclude

New-CanvasUser
    make defaults configurable somehow
    add additional flags

Set-CanvasCourse
    needs way more params


Get-CanvasCourse
    find by name, exception if not found

Get-CanvasUser
    find by login_id, exception if not found
